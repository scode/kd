This file records intentional behavior that is easy to mistake for a bug during review.

## ImageMagick-dependent tests

The image resizing tests may skip themselves when the `magick` command is unavailable.

ImageMagick is still a runtime requirement for image operations. The skip exists so ordinary Rust validation can run in
environments that have the Rust toolchain but not the external image-processing binary installed. A test environment
that needs to prove end-to-end thumbnail behavior must install ImageMagick and run the same tests with `magick`
available on `PATH`.

This means a passing `cargo test` run without ImageMagick proves the pure Rust code still compiles and its
non-ImageMagick helpers still behave correctly. It does not prove that thumbnail resizing works end to end.

## kd ubiworker

- Ownership of a VM is structural, not tracked in a side database: a VM is a "ubiworker" iff its name starts with
  `ubiworker-` _and_ it lives in location `us-east-a2`. Both conditions are required.
- Infra shape (location, size, storage, boot image) is a set of hardcoded constants, not CLI flags. A ubiworker is meant
  to be one fixed, disposable shape; something else should be built by hand with `ubi` directly.
- A default worker name is `ubiworker-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` in the local timezone, with no collision-avoidance suffix.
  Ubicloud rejects a duplicate name server-side, so kd doesn't need to detect the collision itself.
- `create` returns as soon as `ubi vm create` returns. It does not poll for the VM to actually join the tailnet.
- Every minted tailscale auth key is one-use, ephemeral, preauthorized, tagged `tag:ubicloud`, and expires after one
  hour. The VM's own first-boot script retries joining the tailnet several times over several minutes; because the key
  is only consumed by a _successful_ `tailscale up`, retrying with the same key across failed attempts is safe.
- The minted auth key passes through the `ubi` process's argv on the host running `kd`, and is visible to local process
  inspection (e.g. procfs) for as long as that `ubi` invocation runs. kd strips `UBI_DEBUG` from `ubi`'s environment and
  redacts its own logging/error output, but the argv exposure itself is accepted current behavior. The only way to
  remove it entirely is to stop shelling out to the `ubi` CLI and create VMs via Ubicloud's REST API instead — a larger
  change left for later.
- `list` prints nothing to stdout when no ubiworkers exist; it logs a note at info level to stderr instead, so a caller
  piping `list`'s output sees a clean empty stream rather than a line to filter out.
- `destroy` always resolves its target by listing owned VMs (whether or not a name was given) and requires confirmation
  unless `--yes` is passed. It destroys by the VM's immutable id, not by name. Malformed `ubi vm list` output is a hard
  error rather than something `destroy`/`list` tolerate and skip past.
- Destruction is asynchronous on Ubicloud's side (`ubi` reports "scheduled for destruction"), so a just-destroyed worker
  keeps showing up in `kd ubiworker list` until Ubicloud actually reaps it. That's Ubicloud's semantics surfacing, not
  stale caching in kd — kd holds no state of its own.
